 Write a comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document) for a simple coffee shop backend built using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and M-Pesa integration for payments via STK Push.
The application should:

Provide an API endpoint (/pay) where a user can initiate a payment by submitting their phone number and the amount.

Generate an access token from the Safaricom M-Pesa sandbox API before initiating payment.

Use M-Pesa STK Push (CustomerPayBillOnline) to request a payment from the user.

Handle asynchronous payment confirmation via a /callback endpoint and insert payment details into a MySQL table (payments).

The payments table stores:

payment_id: UUID

number: Customer's phone number

amount: Payment amount

transaction_id: M-Pesa receipt number

timestamp: Auto-generated by MySQL

The PRD should include:

Product Overview

Core Features

Technical Requirements

Database Schema

API Endpoints (with method, URL, description, and request/response examples)

External Integration Details (M-Pesa)

Environment Configuration (.env variables)

Non-Functional Requirements (e.g. error handling, logging, CORS support)
