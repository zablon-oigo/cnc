## 📝 Steps
1. ✍️ Write a prompt to generate a project requirement document, describing what the project entails using Natural Language.
Copy the sample prompt below and paste it into any LLM (Large Language Model).

    **Sample prompt**
    ```
     Write a comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document) for a simple coffee shop backend built using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and M-Pesa integration for payments via STK Push.
    The application should:
    
    Provide an API endpoint (/pay) where a user can initiate a payment by submitting their phone number and the amount.
    
    Generate an access token from the Safaricom M-Pesa sandbox API before initiating payment.
    
    Use M-Pesa STK Push (CustomerPayBillOnline) to request a payment from the user.
    
    Handle asynchronous payment confirmation via a /callback endpoint and insert payment details into a MySQL table (payments).
    
    The payments table stores:
    
    payment_id: UUID
    
    number: Customer's phone number
    
    amount: Payment amount
    
    transaction_id: M-Pesa receipt number
    
    timestamp: Auto-generated by MySQL
    
    The PRD should include:
    
    Product Overview
    
    Core Features
    
    Technical Requirements
    
    Database Schema
    
    API Endpoints (with method, URL, description, and request/response examples)
    
    External Integration Details (M-Pesa)
    
    Environment Configuration (.env variables)
    
    Non-Functional Requirements (e.g. error handling, logging, CORS support)
    
    ```
    
2. 🔑 **Generate the PRD:**
Copy the PRD generated and paste it in a code editor, preferably *cursor ai*.
This PRD outlines the full scope of the backend application, including payment processing via M-Pesa and database interactions. It provides a structured roadmap for     developers to implement the system efficiently and effectively. 🚀
